Riddle me this…<br>
    <br>
What happens when I have AI rewrite<br> 
All The News That’s Fit To Print<br>
Then serve it up free of charge<br>
Is that a death knell to the truth<br>
Or freedom heaven sent?<br>
<br>
Democracies Die In Darkness<br>
But who is drowning out all the light?<br>
The longer you ignore me<br>
The stronger I grow.<br> 
Who am I?<br>
Inquiring minds want to know.<br>
<br>
I’m an authoritarian’s best friend.<br>
<br>
I’m the one hogging the spotlight.<br>
Why?<br>
Because I can.<br>
And because you can’t stop me.<br>
You don’t know how to fight this fight.<br>
The only democracies that will survive<br> 
Are the ones who see the light.<br>
<br>
Do I have your attention yet?<br>
Let me know when I do.<br> 
Otherwise, I’ll keep turning the screws loose<br>
Until the whole world comes unglued.<br>
It’s up to you..<br>
<br>
Ready or not,<br> 
I’m coming for you,<br> 
And Lady Liberty too.<br> 
It’s game time.<br>
Let’s see your best moves.<br>
<br> 
Xoxo,<br>

If you want to understand<br>
Democracy’s demise<br>
