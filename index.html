Riddle me this…

What happens when I have AI rewrite 
All The News That’s Fit To Print
Then serve it up free of charge
Is that a death knell to the truth
Or freedom heaven sent?

Democracies Die In Darkness
But who is drowning out all the light?
The longer you ignore me
The stronger I grow. 
Who am I?
Inquiring minds want to know.

I’m an authoritarian’s best friend.

I’m the one hogging the spotlight.
Why?
Because I can. 
And because you can’t stop me.
You don’t know how to fight this fight. 
The only democracies that will survive 
Are the ones who see the light.

Do I have your attention yet?
Let me know when I do. 
Otherwise, I’ll keep turning the screws loose
Until the whole world comes unglued.
It’s up to you..

Ready or not, 
I’m coming for you, 
And Lady Liberty too. 
It’s game time.
Let’s see your best moves.

Xoxo,
C.A.

If you want to understand
Democracy’s demise
You have to understand the game
It’s called an <b>
